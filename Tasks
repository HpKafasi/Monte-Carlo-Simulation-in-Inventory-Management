Task 1: What would be the reasonable range of the order number 𝑦𝑦 and re-order stock level 𝑟𝑟? 
Without using simulation, what would you choose for the order number 𝑦𝑦 and re-order stock level 𝑟𝑟?
Please explain your reason(s).


Task 2: For your chosen order number 𝑦𝑦 and re-order stock level 𝑟𝑟, use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate your expected total cost
over the 52 weeks. Please generate 500 estimates of the total cost. What is the sample mean and variance of your estimate? 
Use a histogram to visualize your result.


Task 3: Instead of choosing order number 𝑦𝑦 and re-order stock level 𝑟𝑟 by intuition, use the Monte Carlo simulation method to find 
the combination of 𝑦𝑦 and 𝑟𝑟 that will lead to the minimum total cost.
Is this choice the same as that arrived at by intuition? Please explain why they are (or not) the same.


Task 4: How confident are you about your conclusion in Task 3? Can you describe this mathematically?
How would you improve your confidence level? Evidence this.



Task 5: Critically evaluate your work. Have you achieved the objectives? What problems did you find during this work?
What conclusions can you draw from your design? How would you improve your estimate/design?
From the experience of this work, what do you need to consider when solving a practical problem?
