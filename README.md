Monte Carlo Simulation by resolving in Matlab


This paper investigates the principle of Monte Carlo Simulation by evaluating minimum cost for inventory management problems. Monte Carlo simulation is a widely used technique in probabilistic analysis of engineering systems and obtains the statistics of the output variables of a computational model. In each experiment, it produces repeated random samples based on their distribution and makes a decision by using their average. A number of experiments are carried out in this paper to minimize the cost during the 52th-week period for flagship store of Super Apple.
